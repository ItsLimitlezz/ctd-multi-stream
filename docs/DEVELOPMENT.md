# Development

How to run, test and extend CTD Relay from source on Windows or Linux. The design is in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). Module boundaries, interfaces and coding rules are in [CONTRACTS.md](CONTRACTS.md).

## Requirements

- **Node.js 24.7 or newer** (`node --version`). The server uses the built-in `node:sqlite` and `crypto.argon2`.
- npm (bundled with Node) and Git.
- Windows 10/11 or Linux, x64 or arm64. macOS works for most things, but `setup-tools` has no pinned builds there: run `brew install ffmpeg mediamtx` and point `MEDIAMTX_BIN` / `FFMPEG_BIN` at them.

## First-time setup

```bash
npm ci
npm run setup-tools                 # pinned, checksum-verified MediaMTX + FFmpeg/ffprobe into ./tools
npx playwright install chromium     # Linux: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

`./tools`, `./data` and `./dist` are git-ignored.

## Run locally

Run the server with HTTPS off, so it serves plain HTTP on port 8443:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:TLS_MODE = 'off'; npm run dev
```

```bash
# Linux
TLS_MODE=off npm run dev
```

- The server restarts on changes (`tsx watch`). Data goes to `./data` (database, `master.key`, MediaMTX config).
- On the first start the terminal prints a setup code: look for `setupCode`. You need it to create the admin account.
- RTMP ingest listens on `rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live`. Point OBS on the same machine there.
- Locked out of a local instance: `npm run cli -- list-users` and `npm run cli -- reset-password <username>` (same `DATA_DIR` as the server; it can keep running). In the image the same commands are `node dist/server/src/cli.js …`.

For the web UI, run the Vite dev server in a second terminal:

```bash
npm run dev:web     # http://localhost:5173
```

It proxies `/api` and `/overlay` (including WebSockets) to `http://127.0.0.1:8443`. Set `CTD_DEV_API` to use another backend address. Alternatively, `npm run build:web` once and open `http://localhost:8443`: the server serves `dist/web` when it exists.

Useful environment variables while developing (all in [`.env.example`](../.env.example)):

| Variable | Use |
|---|---|
| `TLS_MODE=off` | Plain HTTP, no certificate handling |
| `TLS_MODE=self-signed` | Test the HTTPS path without Let's Encrypt (`https://localhost:8443`) |
| `BROWSER_HEADLESS=false` | Show the automation browser's window, handy when writing selectors |
| `LOG_LEVEL=debug` | More detail, including MediaMTX output |
| `DATA_DIR` | Use another data folder, e.g. a throwaway one |

`npm run dev` doesn't read `.env` files. Set variables in the shell, or run `node --env-file=.env …` yourself.

### Going live locally without OBS or a platform

`npm run dev:sim` (scripts/dev-sim.mts) turns a running dev server into a complete live rig:

- **Fake OBS:** it publishes FFmpeg test patterns to the landscape (1920x1080@60) and vertical (1080x1920@30) feeds, with 2 s keyframes, and restarts them if they stop.
- **Fake platform:** it starts a fake RTMP platform on `127.0.0.1:19400` and points a Custom RTMP destination, "Local sink (dev-sim)", at it.

Start a session in the web UI (or turn on auto go-live) and Relay goes live end to end: the feed cards, destination cards and stats all move. Press Ctrl+C to stop everything.

It signs in with `SIM_USER` / `SIM_PASS`, else with `data-dev/TEST-CREDENTIALS.txt` (git-ignored). `SIM_BASE` sets the server address (default `http://localhost:8443`), `SIM_SINK_PORT` the fake platform's port, and `SIM_VERTICAL=0` sends landscape only.

## Tests and checks

```bash
npm run typecheck                       # server + shared (tsconfig.test.json) and web (web/tsconfig.json)
npm test                                # Vitest, two projects (vitest.config.ts):
                                        #   server: server/src/**/*.test.ts, shared/**/*.test.ts, scripts/**/*.test.{ts,mjs}
                                        #   web:    web/src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}
npx vitest run server/src/media         # one folder
npx vitest run --project web            # one project
npx vitest list --filesOnly             # which files each project collects
npm run build                           # dist/server + dist/web
npm run smoke                           # end-to-end media relay test with the real binaries in ./tools
```

- Tests never touch the network or real platform accounts. Platform drivers are tested with stubbed `fetch` and local HTML fixtures.
- Browser tests drive a real headless Chromium. Set `CI_NO_BROWSER=1` to skip them on machines without it.
- The smoke test starts MediaMTX and FFmpeg on non-default ports, publishes a test pattern, checks that a wrong key is rejected, relays to a local fake platform and prints PASS or FAIL.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same typecheck, tests and build on every push and pull request.

## Production build without Docker

```bash
npm ci && npm run build
npm start      # node dist/server/src/index.js
```

Set `DATA_DIR`, `MEDIAMTX_BIN`, `FFMPEG_BIN` and `WEB_DIR` as needed. The image sets them for you (see the `Dockerfile`).

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t ctd-relay .
docker compose up -d --build                  # build from this checkout and run (see docker-compose.yml)
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t ghcr.io/itslimitlezz/ctd-relay .
```

The `Dockerfile` is multi-stage: build on the host's architecture, install production dependencies and Playwright Chromium for the target architecture, and download the pinned MediaMTX/FFmpeg builds with `scripts/setup-tools.mjs`. The runtime image runs as uid/gid 568 with `tini` as PID 1, and its health check is `scripts/healthcheck.mjs`.

## Releasing

1. Bump `version` in `package.json` (the app reports it in **Settings → About** and `/healthz`).
2. Tag the commit `vX.Y.Z` and push the tag.
3. `.github/workflows/docker.yml` builds `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` and pushes `ghcr.io/itslimitlezz/ctd-relay:X.Y.Z` (and the same tags under the pre-rename `ctd-multi-stream`), `:X.Y` and `:latest`. Every push to `main` publishes `:main` and `:sha-<commit>`.

The first time the workflow publishes, GitHub creates the package as **private**. Make it public (the package's **Package settings → Change visibility**) so TrueNAS and Docker hosts can pull it without logging in.

## Adding a platform

A platform is a **driver**: a stateless object implementing `PlatformDriver` from `server/src/platforms/types.ts`.

1. Add the id to `PlatformId` and `PLATFORM_IDS` in `shared/types.ts`.
2. Create `server/src/platforms/<id>/index.ts` exporting `export const <id>Driver: PlatformDriver`, and register it in `server/src/platforms/registry.ts`.
3. Describe the platform in `info` (`PlatformInfo`): accepted `feeds` and `defaultFeed`, `connectMethod`, `accountFields`, `destinationFields` (with `target: 'ingestUrl' | 'streamKey'` for server URLs and keys), `developerApp` (console URL, fields, numbered setup steps), `titleSupport`, `chatSupport`, `keyPerSession`, `experimental` and short `notes`. The web UI renders all forms from this, so no UI code is needed.
4. Implement the connection: `startConnect` / `pollConnect` (device code) or `completeConnect` (OAuth paste-back, token paste, browser login), plus `checkAccount`. Use the helpers in `platforms/common/oauth.ts`. Store tokens only through `ctx.accountSecrets`.
5. Implement `prepare(dest, account, title, ctx)`: set the title (**only** the title, never the category or game), get the ingest URL and key, create the live if the platform needs one, and return a `PreparedLive`: `push` (`{ url, mode: 'copy', feeds }`), and optionally `watchUrl`, `confirm` (e.g. click "Go live" once video arrives), `setTitle`, `end` and `chat`.
6. Browser-driven platforms: get pages from `ctx.browser.page(account.id)`, use the helpers in `server/src/browser/helpers.ts`, keep every selector in `selectors.ts`, prefer role and text locators, save the session after successful flows, and throw `DriverError(…, 'needs-login')` when logged out.
7. Rules: throw `DriverError` with the right code for anything the user must fix (the message is shown verbatim); pass `ctx.signal` to every request and wait; never log stream keys, tokens or URLs that contain them.
8. Tests in the driver folder: stub `fetch` for API flows, serve HTML fixtures from a local `node:http` server for browser flows.
9. Document it in [PLATFORMS.md](PLATFORMS.md) and the README's platform table.
